Color Choices
I will keep a darker background with a professional look and choose mostly white colors. Black background with white colors is easier on the eyes and easier to read. If after the layout is complete and I decide the colors aren't "Professional" I will go with a white/gray background and black font.

Font Choices
I like Helvetica and will take the instructors recommendation for the font style.

Navigation Choices
Everything will be on one page and have quick links that float on top of the page to have quick access to each section on the page. I will have hyperlinks where possible to quick information on technical skills.
